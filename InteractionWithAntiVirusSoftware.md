Windows-privesc-check shouldn't get misidentified as a virus.

Some methods of creating the .exe can cause alerts to be raised by AV software.  This problems has occured with Molebox and UPX during testing.  However, there seems to be no such problem with pyinstaller.

According to http://www.virustotal.com, 42 AV scanners don't think it's a virus.

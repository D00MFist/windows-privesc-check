Windows-privesc-check is still in its early stages of development (Aug 2010).  It already contains lots of useful checks that may help you when performing security audits or pentests.  However, it has not been extensively tested.  Some features are incomplete or just plain experimental.

The features, command line options and pretty much every aspect of this project are open to change without notice.
